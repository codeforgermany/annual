      <h3>MODULE 1: The Open Knowledge Labs</h3>
      <p>Implementation of the first module started in Spring 2014 by starting a network of Open Knowledge Labs (OK Labs), inspired in part by Code for America’s Brigade program. In a growing number of cities across Germany, CfG began offering individuals a focal point to meet and network, building a local open data community where like-minded people could create innovative web or mobile solutions for their own city. 
      </p>
      <p>
      OK Labs either use the data the city already provides (open government data), or help the city to release more open data. The OK Lab network in Germany also aims to connect  Labs across the country so that ideas and applications can be recycled and re-purposed. OK Labs alone attract around 200 people to meetups on a regular basis and at the time this was written there are 13 Labs throughout Germany. While each of the OK Labs are only loosely integrated with each other, a healthy amount of exchange of ideas and code happens between them.</p>

          <h4>MODULE 2: Peers and Partners Network</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Thanks to OK Labs, volunteer groups across the country are actively contributing to open (government) data projects and actively collaborating with each other to do so. Communication inside and between city administrations has proven to be quite a different process to initiate. For the vast majority of government departments, open government/open data is not on the agenda; until recently, drawing upon the civic-tech approach was a rare undertaking, or not considered a worthwhile path to identify solutions to governmental problems. In the cities who do engage in open data activities, the majority of their efforts are pioneered by a few individuals or small groups, oftentimes scattered across the organization. Only very few places such as Berlin, Cologne, Moers, Ulm and a few others, have “active” open data agendas that prioritize and outline the importance of defining an open data policy for an entire region, establishing dedicated roles to further advance this issue area for the region, committing to regularly publishing data sets, and building community ties. 
          <p>
          Given this context, it became apparent that a key piece of CfG’s approach would be to create a network of government officials that would enable peers from across cities to partner with one another and build coalitions to further the IT innovation landscape in government in Germany. The Peers and Partners Network is thus created as an online forum that provides Google Hangouts, webinar trainings, and the sharing of resources for the German administration. It operates similarly to the CfA Peer Network. </p>

          <h4>MODULE 3: The Incubator</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>We want to systematically support potential new businesses created by the apps and APIs that emerge across the program. In this program, the core value of code availability and re-use that is integral to all three other programs is combined with analysis, so that promising apps can flourish into viable business models. In this manner, the Incubator program would help teams take their app and api designs to build them into full-blown products that can gain investment and funding opportunities. The goal for this program is to strengthen Germany’s civic-tech ecosystem by establishing startups and social enterprises around open data and respective open source apps. The first incubator will be kicked off in Berlin in 2015 in partnership with the Technology Foundation Berlin. </P>

          <h4>MODULE 4: The Fellowship </h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>After the first three modules are well established and have completed web products, CfG has plans to kick off the fellowship program.</P>
