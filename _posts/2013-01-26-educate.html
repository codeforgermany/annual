      <h3>MODULE 1: The Open Knowledge Labs</h3>
      <p>Spring 2014 saw the implementation of the first program module: the network of Open Knowledge Labs (OK Labs), inspired in part by Code for America’s Brigade program. In a growing number of cities across Germany, CfG began offering individuals a focal point to meet and network, building a local open data community where like-minded people could create innovative web or mobile solutions for their own city. 
      </p>
      <p>
      OK Labs either use the data the city already provides (open government data), or help the city to release more open data. The OK Lab network in Germany also aims to connect  Labs across the country so that ideas and applications can be recycled and re-purposed. OK Labs alone attract around 200 people to meetups on a regular basis and at the time this was written there are 13 Labs throughout Germany. While the OK Labs are only loosely coupled, a healthy amount of exchange of ideas and code happens between them.</p>

          <h4>MODULE 2: Peers and Partners Network</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>In this context, it became apparent that a similar networking approach as with the Labs could enable peers from across cities to partner up and also build political coalitions to further the government innovation landscape in Germany. The idea of the Peers and Partners Network not only to be a hands-on online and offline cooperation network for best-practice sharing and the like, but we also hope to support an emerging policial alliance that stands by public commitments to civic tech and open government. Thus, we aim for re-mix of the CfA Peer Network and the Open Governemnt Partnership - for cities. </p>

          <h4>MODULE 3: The Incubator</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>We want to systematically support potential new businesses created by the apps and APIs that emerge across the program. In this module, the core value of code availability and re-use that is integral to all other modules is combined with analysis, so that promising apps can flourish into viable business models. In this manner, the Incubator module would help teams take their app and api designs to build them into full-blown products that can gain investment and funding opportunities. The goal for this module is to strengthen Germany’s civic-tech ecosystem by establishing startups and social enterprises around open data and respective open source apps. The first incubator will be kicked off in Berlin in 2015 in partnership with the Technology Foundation Berlin. </P>

          <h4>MODULE 4: The Fellowship </h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>With the other modules well established over time and with some track record to show, CfG aims to also implement a fellowship program.</P>
