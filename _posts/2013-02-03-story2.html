              <p>One of the projects deals with the planned modification of the big city park “Tempelhofer Feld” which used to be an airport, and has been converted into a giant open field that is being used by numerous citizens as a recreational area. There were plans to convert the space once again, but these plans were opened up to public debate in a referendum. Stefan, a member of OK Lab Berlin, saw an opportunity here and thought of a way to help citizens comprehend what changes are being planned for the Tempelhofer Feld, in order to enable them to make an informed decision. A team from a local newspaper joined the effort and supported Stefan and helped him build an application that would represent the pending plan ideas in 3D form. The result was a beautiful and helpful visualization that was published on the newspaper’s website prior to the referendum, to prepare and inform citizens before their vote. In part because of the  collaboration with the newspaper, the project received a lot of publicity and attention from the public and got an extremely positive response.</p>
              <p> The OK Lab Heilbronn was inspired by this idea, and is now planning to build a similar application for the upcoming BUGA, the National Garden Exhibition, to depict the building plans that are in the works.</p>

              <p><strong>The OK Lab in Berlin has an active membership pool of approximately twenty people, with many more people visiting the OK Lab from time to time. Several of the apps that are being worked on focus on city planning and urban development, in part because Berlin is such a booming and ever-evolving city. </strong>
