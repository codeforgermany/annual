            <p>Every day governments gather massive amounts of data, about everything from building safety to
            restaurant cleanliness.</p>
            <p>There have been very active applications such as mappable.info and Data Driven Journalism Hamburg. They invite both journalists and civic hackers to their meet-ups, and generally 20 people come together and meet every two weeks to uncover new journalism stories and to build tools for their city. OK Lab Hamburg is very well connected with its city officials, possibly due to the fact that the city of Hamburg was the first city in Germany to introduce a Transparency Law.  As a result, all public datasets were required by law to be opened beginning in autumn 2014, which will give this OK Lab plenty of resources to keep a high momentum.

            Since February this OK Lab has been working on a variety of visualizations and projects. Their main focus is on geospatial data and topics like gentrification. One of the Lab’s latest projects is a map that shows how trees in public spaces contribute to air quality in Hamburg. For the map they used data from the city’s tree database to display tree types and their CO2 levels. But visualizing the data is just a first step as the data allows for much more. This Lab is also planning build another related/integrated app that outlines the pollen level in specific areas, and offers mechanisms to adopt a tree in your neighbourhood. </p>

              <p><strong>The initial impetus behind forming an OK Lab in Hamburg came from a group of open data experts whose focus is on the visualization of data and data journalism.</strong>
