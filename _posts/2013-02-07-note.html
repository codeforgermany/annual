        <p>Code for Germany set out to answer three questions: How can community life in Germany be improved? How can collaborative approaches enabled by new technologies make significant contributions? How can city governments leverage external know-how to become more citizen-centric, transparent, and efficient?</p>
        <p>
        By tackling these questions, Code for Germany aims to contribute to an IT-based German government administration landscape that offers comprehensive digital services to its citizens. By deepening cooperation between city governments and local civic tech communities, Code for Germany hopes to sustain long-lasting partnerships among all residential stakeholders. To achieve this, Code for Germany has been developing four different modules of citizen-government collaboration that together will comprise the Code for Germany program. They build upon each other and, together, form the pieces of a larger “civic innovation process.”
