            <p>When Code for Germany launched, the group decided to join the program to connect better with like-minded people all across Germany and share their knowledge and experience in the field. In the past few years the group has been working on several interesting applications. Thanks to the innovative and open minded mayor of Ulm they never run out of data. They are in close contact with city officials, who provide them with first hand information and data.
            </p>
            <p>One of their latest projects is a digital nursery school finder called <a href="http://www.ulmapi.de/kleinerspatz/">“Kleiner Spatz”</a>. Finding a place at nursery school is a prevalent problem in German cities. Places are scarce and parents have to be quick. This is why the team in Ulm built a map that helps parents spot free places and provides them with the contact details of the nursery school. The map uses data of the city and is updated on a monthly basis. The group is currently in touch with the city to get access to an API, so that information on the nursery schools can be updated in real time. UUlm's Kleiner Spatz project has inspired a lot of other OK Labs, Hamburg and Dresden are currently working on redeploying the project.</p>

              <p><strong>Ulm has a quite active open data community. A group of students from the technical university in Ulm started an open data group called “Ulm API” a couple of years ago.</strong>
