            <p>Drinking tap water is quite popular in Germany, therefore this OK Lab decided to build an app that analyzes and shares the quality of local water. In close cooperation with the local administration, they managed to open the local water data and combined it with already accessible information. To spread the word about the project they collaborated with a local newspaper and launched a “What´s in my tap water?” campaign. Not only is the site very informative, providing a breakdown of water contamination and minerals, but it includes visuals and charts, as well. This user-friendly app has proven to be a great product to share because it clearly depicts the usefulness and relevance of Open Data, and is a very effective “door opener” for discussions with city officials who might be unclear on the benefits of civic tech.

            Another great app-idea by OK Lab Heilbronn was to visualize the statistics on theft in their region, mostly in order to compare it over time and report on the seemingly rapid growth of incidents. The local police department  opened up the data for the Lab, and since then the application Crime Map has been featured in several articles in the local press.

              <p><strong>Heilbronn - Although Heilbronn is one of the smallest cities in the program, the  
              community is very active and well connected to city government and the local press. 
              The OK Lab in Heilbronn has been working on a variety of topics that are directly 
              linked to the everyday life of citizens.
